Receive any two number as input from user (at run-time) in any two variables say num1 and num2
Calculate the square of both the number one by one and initialized its square to any two variables say sqr1 and sqr2
That is num1*num1 gets initialized to sqr1 and num2*num2 gets initialized to sqr2
Now calculate sum of two variable say sqr1 (square of first number) and sqr2 (square of second number)
That is sqr1+sqr2 gets initialized to a variable say sum (holds summation value of square of the two given number)
Print the value of sum at last of the program
For example, if user enters 4 and 5 as input
Therefore, num1 holds 4 and num2 holds 5
Now num1*num1 or 4*4 or 16 gets initialized to sqr1
And num2*num2 or 5*5 or 25 gets initialized to sqr2
And sqr1+sqr2 or 16+25 or 41 gets initialized to sum
Print the value of sum which is 41 as output
